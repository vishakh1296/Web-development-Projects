							<p>You can find houses and apartments for rent in Canada in the classifieds section of local newspapers, libraries, and on websites such as Rent Panda, Kijiji and Facebook groups for newcomers to Canada are also useful. In many cities, you can simply walk around your preferred neighborhood, as landlords will post signs outside their property advertising available vacancies.</p>

Documents that could be submitted include a report from your new or more recent boss that shows your total income. Bank records that prove you have enough funds to pay the rent for a few months. References from former tenants.</p>
